### Some example footage of mine (lowered resolution)

<video src="https://github.com/murdockFPV/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/test_video.mp4?raw=true" poster="https://github.com/murdockFPV/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/poster_vid_test.png?raw=true" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%" controls preload></video>

*Thanks for visiting my blog!* This specific page is me posting a short example of some of my drone footage. You are welcome to view this as an example if you were to contact me for my services.

#### More information

* Emails have file size limits, even sending a short preview of an UltraHD video can prove difficult. This page uses web-hosting for the content and allows me to show you a preview of footage I might capture for you.
* The full resolution files are huge at 4K resolution and up to 60 FPS, I exported this video in such a way with lowered resolution so that **this video is only 17MB. I can capture single .JPG images 30-40 MB**. Videos only a couple of minutes long are multiple GB at UltraHD resolution.
