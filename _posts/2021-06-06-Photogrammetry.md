> Creating a 3D Digital Terrain Map using my Mavic Air 2 & DroneLink

### Photogrammetry

Photogrammetry takes georeferenced metadata from photos (GPS position, direction, angle of camera) and tri-angulates them with other photos in order to create a 3D model. Using my drone I am able to map 30 acres per hour of flight time, accurate to 2cm.

I can provide this service for surveying, mapping, site planning, jobsite monitoring and verification, and virtual reality applications. Creating a digital terrain map (DTM) is the most comprehensive way to create an understanding of every facet of a location. If a tree fell through a roof, an aerial 3D scan could provide accurate and helpful information for a variety of purposes. Please inquire with any questions!
