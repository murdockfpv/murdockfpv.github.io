> Creating a 3D Digital Terrain Map using my Mavic Air 2 & DroneLink

### Photogrammetry

Photogrammetry takes georeferenced metadata from photos (GPS position, direction, angle of camera) and tri-angulates them with other photos in order to create a 3D model. Using my drone I am able to map 30 acres per hour of flight time, accurate to 2cm.

I can provide this service for surveying purposes, mapping, site planning, jobsite monitoring and verification, and virtual reality applications. Creating a digital terrain map is the most comprehensive way to create an understanding of a location from all angles. By performing an aerial 3D scan, accurate and helpful information can be attained for a variety of purposes. When a tree falls through a roof and the structure needs to be inspected - a 3D model can help plan reconstruction. When you are wondering how progress is going on your construction project or perhaps how much soil has been disturbed in the process - a digital terrain map spares no details. Please inquire with any questions!
