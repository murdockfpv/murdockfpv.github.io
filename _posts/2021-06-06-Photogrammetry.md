### Photogrammetry

Photogrammetry takes georeferenced metadata from photos (GPS position, direction, angle of camera) and tri-angulates them with other photos in order to create a 3D model. Using my drone I am able to acheive close to 2cm of accuracy over a scan of 15 acres in about half an hour of flight time plus some time in post-processing.

I can provide this service for site planning/surveying, digital twin/extended reality applications, and jobsite monitoring. Please inquire with any questions!
