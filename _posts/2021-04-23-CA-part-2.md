> I drove back home after my vacation and was able to take more photos! I must return to Mount Hood and spend some time taking more photos, it is such an imposing and stunning mountain.

That's my girlfriend, she's so cute. There is a pretty cool waterfall in the distance, and I could've spent hours flying here. One of the first places we stopped and we couldn't stop for long.

Usually when you think of drones you think they just fly up - but they can fly over cliffs and then down into a valley like this. My DJI Fly app said I was at -90 feet when I took this 360-photo.

## Mt Hood

Absolutely need a panoramic photo closer to Mt Hood. It is so dramatic and imposing. There were some better spots to stop, but we were only halfway home and it was getting dark.

Thank you so much for the incredible hospitality while you let me stay at your place, and for taking me to cool spots in your area. The lava tubes at [Hat Creek](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lassen/recarea/?recid=11435) were so incredible. (Was not able to fly my drone for that little adventure). I will absolutely be back to Lassen & Plumas County.
