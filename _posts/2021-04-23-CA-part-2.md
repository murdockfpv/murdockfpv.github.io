> On my drive back home I was able to take some more photos! I checked out inside a lava tube, and saw some beautiful lakes and rivers and mountains.

That's my girlfriend, she's so cute. There is a pretty cool waterfall in the distance, and I could've spent hours flying here. One of the first places we stopped and we couldn't stop for long.

Usually when you think of drones you think they just fly up - but they can fly over cliffs and then down into a valley like this. My monitor said I was at -90 feet when I took this.

## Mt Hood

Absolutely need a panoramic photo closer to Mt Hood. It was so dramatic and imposing, this photo does no justice to it's size or beauty. There were some better spots that I could've stopped, but we were only halfway home and it was already getting dark.

Thank you so much for the incredible hospitality while you let me stay at your place, and for taking me to cool spots in your area. The lava tubes at [Hat Creek](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lassen/recarea/?recid=11435) were so incredible. (Was not able to fly my drone inside)
